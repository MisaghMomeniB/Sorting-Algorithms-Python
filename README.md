# 🎉 **Sorting Algorithms in Python** 💻✨

Welcome to the ultimate sorting showdown! In this Python script, we’ve got five **legendary sorting algorithms** going head-to-head:  
**Bubble Sort**, **Selection Sort**, **Insertion Sort**, **Quick Sort**, and **Merge Sort**. Each one has its own style and strategy, but in the end, they all deliver a sorted array. 🤩

---

## 1. 🫧 **Bubble Sort** – The Gentle Giant

Bubble Sort might not be the fastest, but it’s classic and easy to understand. It compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they’re in the wrong order. Think of it as a "bubble" floating to the top – it keeps moving until it’s in its rightful place!

```python
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):  # Traverse through the unsorted portion
            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:  # Compare adjacent elements
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]  # Swap if out of order
    return arr
```

🔍 **How it works:**  
Bubble Sort walks through the array and pushes larger values toward the end, like bubbles popping to the surface. It keeps doing this until no more swaps are needed. 🚶‍♂️

## 2. 🔎 **Selection Sort** – The Strategist

Selection Sort is like choosing the best player for the team. It goes through the entire list and selects the smallest (or largest) element, placing it in its correct position, then continues with the rest. 🏅

```python
def selection_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        min_idx = i
        for j in range(i+1, n):  # Find the minimum element in the unsorted part
            if arr[j] < arr[min_idx]:  # If current element is smaller, update min_idx
                min_idx = j
        arr[i], arr[min_idx] = arr[min_idx], arr[i]  # Swap the found min with the first unsorted element
    return arr
```

🔍 **How it works:**  
This algorithm selects the smallest element from the unsorted part and places it at the beginning. It keeps doing that for each position until the list is sorted. 🏆

---

## 3. ✋ **Insertion Sort** – The Diligent Worker

Insertion Sort is like organizing a deck of cards. You pick one card at a time, insert it in the correct position in the already sorted part, and then continue. 🔄

```python
def insertion_sort(arr):
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        key = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and key < arr[j]:  # Move elements of arr[0..i-1] that are greater than key to one position ahead
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j -= 1
        arr[j + 1] = key  # Place key after the last element smaller than it
    return arr
```

🔍 **How it works:**  
Insertion Sort builds a sorted list by inserting elements one by one into their correct positions. Like a super-organized worker making sure everything is in order. 🔧

## 4. ⚡ **Quick Sort** – The Speedster

Quick Sort is a high-speed, divide-and-conquer algorithm. It picks a **pivot**, divides the array into smaller parts, and recursively sorts them. It’s like splitting a problem into manageable chunks and solving each part. 🔥

```python
def quick_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:  # Base case: if the list has one or zero elements, it's already sorted
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choose the middle element as the pivot
    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]  # Elements smaller than pivot
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Elements equal to pivot
    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]  # Elements greater than pivot
    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)  # Recursively sort and combine
```

🔍 **How it works:**  
Quick Sort’s power lies in its recursive strategy. It divides the list into smaller sub-lists based on a pivot, sorting them, and then combines everything back together. 🚀

---

## 5. 🔄 **Merge Sort** – The Master of Divide and Conquer

Merge Sort is the tactician’s favorite. It divides the array into halves, sorts them individually, and then merges them back together in sorted order. It’s an efficient, **divide-and-conquer** approach that always gets the job done. ⚔️

```python
def merge_sort(arr):
    if len(arr) > 1:  # Only sort if the list has more than one element
        mid = len(arr) // 2
        left_half = arr[:mid]
        right_half = arr[mid:]
        merge_sort(left_half)  # Sort the left half
        merge_sort(right_half)  # Sort the right half
        i = j = k = 0
        while i < len(left_half) and j < len(right_half):  # Merge the sorted halves
            if left_half[i] < right_half[j]:
                arr[k] = left_half[i]
                i += 1
            else:
                arr[k] = right_half[j]
                j += 1
            k += 1
        while i < len(left_half):  # If there are remaining elements in left_half
            arr[k] = left_half[i]
            i += 1
            k += 1
        while j < len(right_half):  # If there are remaining elements in right_half
            arr[k] = right_half[j]
            j += 1
            k += 1
    return arr
```

🔍 **How it works:**  
Merge Sort takes the "divide and conquer" approach, splitting the list until each sub-list is sorted, then merging them back together in a sorted order. Like an army of tiny armies uniting into one! ⚔️

## 🔥 **Test Run the Algorithms!** 🚀

Let’s see these algorithms in action! We’ll test them on the same unsorted array:

```python
arr = [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]
print("Bubble Sort:", bubble_sort(arr[:]))
print("Selection Sort:", selection_sort(arr[:]))
print("Insertion Sort:", insertion_sort(arr[:]))
print("Quick Sort:", quick_sort(arr[:]))
print("Merge Sort:", merge_sort(arr[:]))
```

---

### 📈 **Sample Output**:

```
Bubble Sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
Selection Sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
Insertion Sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
Quick Sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
Merge Sort: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]
```

## 🌟 **Conclusion**: Who’s the Best? 🤔

While all five algorithms correctly sort the list, some are faster or more efficient than others, depending on the size and nature of the data. Here's a quick guide to when each one shines:

- **Bubble Sort**: Easy to understand but slow. Use it for small datasets. 🐢
- **Selection Sort**: Works best for small arrays but isn’t the fastest. 🏅
- **Insertion Sort**: Great for nearly sorted arrays, but not the fastest for large ones. ✋
- **Quick Sort**: Fast, efficient, and often the go-to choice for large datasets. ⚡
- **Merge Sort**: Stable and efficient for large datasets with guaranteed O(n log n) time complexity. 🔄
